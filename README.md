Prototype for a online-based text-editor and file editor. Still in early (EARLY) development and it is currently built in php. 
This is not a complete or perfect build and Has many parts that simply will crash the application and expect these problems to arrise often. Some features are also not secure yet and is not yet intened for use with real user data. 
   
    
    Planned Features:
        File/Project Structures. 
        File downoading and uploading to the application.
        File syntax and highlighting based on user made preferences
        Custom editor settings.
        Multi device support in realtime.
        More...

This project is for my own personal learning and practice and is most likely not going online in the forseeble future.
