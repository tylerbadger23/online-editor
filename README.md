    Basic File & Document Editor

Developed by: Tyler Laceby

    This is a prototype for an online-based text-editor and file editor. This project is built in PHP and Incorporates Jquery and other smaller frameworks and libraries. This project is still in early (EARLY) development and it is currently built as a hobby project. This is not a complete or perfect build and it has many problems that might simply crash the application. If using this code in any way except these problems to arise often. Some features are also not secure yet and are not yet intended for use with real user data (Data sent to the database is not yet secure and still needs to be properly cleaned and rinsed. Also, ALL text editor data is still vulnerable to XSS and SQL attacks)  I am developing this in my free time and want everyone who sees this to understand that this is an incomplete and error-packed package of code. This project is not ready to go online and will have to have a lot of work before it is secure for users.

     Planned Features:

File/Project Structures.
Auto Saving and Syncing every (x) second after finished typing
File downloading and uploading to the application. 
File syntax and highlighting based on user-made preferences
Custom editor settings. 
Multi-device support with real-time saving
Allows users to change their username
Allow users to have at least two template modes for thee editor (Dark/Light) and possibly allow whole website theme customization. 
Password Reset Features Syntax Highlighting depending on user settings - (CSS have different settings then HTML) 
Check how much data users use and cut-off after x MB to make sure the database doesn't fill up too quickly.
Syncing With GoogleDrive and DropBox for easier file access. 
Allow users to eventually upload non-allowed file-types: (images/gifs/videos/pdf/mp3, etc)
Allow users to upload pdf files and convert them to text and reverse. 
Allow users to change/customize fonts, font-size, colors, bold, italics, line-height, line-spacing

    This project is for my own personal learning and practice and is most likely not going online in the foreseeable future. If you want to learn more or help me with this in any way, contact me on Twitter, Instagram, or GitHub.
